Pose tracking set up for BodyWithFeet model in balanced mode.
Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is selected.
Parameters: keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to /Users/chandansharma/Desktop/workspace/metashape/projects/dc-pose/DC-ROM/demo_Sports2D/demo_Sports2D_px_person00.trc.
- Person 1: Less than 4 valid frames. Deleting person.

Converting pose to meters:
Using height of person #0 (1.7m) to convert coordinates in meters. Floor angle: auto (estimation: -0.97Â°), xy_origin: auto (estimation: [0, 438]).
